Have you see the world?
Well, what would you say
If I said that you could?
Just car-ry this gun; you'll ev-en get paid."
I said, "That sounds pret-ty good."

Black leath-er boots
Spit-shined s-o bright
They cut off my hair but it looks a-l-right
We marched and we sang
We all be-came friends
As we learned ho-w to fight

A he-ro of wa-ar
Yeah that's what I'll be
And when I come home
They'll be damn proud of me
I'll car-ry this flag
To the grave if I must
'cause it's a flag that I love
And a flag that I-i trust

I kicked in the door
I yelled my com-mands
The child-ren, they cri-ed
But I got m-y man
We took him a-way
A bag o-ver his face
From his fam-ily and his friends

They took off his clothes
They pissed in his hands
I told them to stop
But then I join-ed in
We beat him with guns
And ba-tons not just once
But a-gain a-nd a-gain

A he-ro of w-ar
Yeah that's what I'll be
And when I come home
They'll be damn proud of me
I'll car-ry this flag
To the grave if I must
'cause it's a flag that I love
And a flag that I-i tru-ust

She walked through bul-lets and haze
I asked her to stop
I begged her to stay
But she pressed on
So I lif-ted my gun
And I fi-red a-way

And the shells jumped through the smoke
And in-to the sand
That the blood now had soaked
She col-lapsed with a flag in her hand
A flag white as snow

A he-ro of war
Is that what they see
Just me-dals and scars
So damn proud of me
And I brought home that flag
Now it ga-thers dust
But it's a flag that I love
It's the on-ly flag I-i trust

He said, "Son, have you seen the world? Well what would you say, if I said that you could?"
